# Movement
Simple, pure javascript game that combines basic html layer with js game alike functionality.

## How to start
You can acess the game through my github sites [here](https://malastrasza.github.io/Movement_js/).
Also you can get there by cloning a repo and launching a project's html in a browser through your code editor.

## How to play
- Use keyboard arrows to move the weird sasquatch face through the board to collect points.
- Passing a wall stops the game.
- With each coin eaten, score rises.

## Simple as it is?
Exactly, simple as it is. This is basically my first project on the github pages. Code itself is condensed to the minimum, making it look quite neat and totally functional.
